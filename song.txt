The other night
I had a dream
It was a world full of kings and queens
But it was cold
Dark as the night
We were the fire under moonlit skies

We were divided
We were the same
And we were free
But we all wore chains
We couldn't see it
But we created

A place between truth and overrated

If I could just see it all
Just like a fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore

Like nothing never happened
Haven't seen you before?

I'm on the run from the thief

I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys
So don't be scared
When I turn and shout
